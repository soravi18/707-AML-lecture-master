    "# Ensemble Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple models - logistic regression, decision trees, naive bayes - are often easy to interpret, but offer lack power and suffer from either high bias or high variance. One way to address this is gathering a large number of simple models together and aggregate the answers of these models to achieve a better, aggregate answer. In human systems, this has been referred to as the \"wisdom of the crowd,\" and it is one of the underpinnings of Western socio-political organizations, being the fundamental motivation for both democracy and the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble methods, at their core, apply the wisdom of the crowds idea to ML.The intuition is simple: if different models, with their unique strengths and weaknesses, make different errors, then combining them can often average out their errors and yield a better prediction.\n",

    "\n",
    "Consider a simple coin toss. If a slightly biased coin has a 51% chance of coming up heads and we toss it a few times, the results could be fairly erratic. It might come up heads 7 times out of 10 or just 3 times out of 10. However, as we toss the coin more and more, the ratio of heads will tend to get closer and closer to the 51%."

    "### **2. Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)** \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2.1 Principle of Operation** \n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging, which stands for **Bootstrap Aggregating**, is an ensemble method that aims to reduce the variance of an estimator by leveraging multiple instances of it. The central idea revolves around the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training instances** are randomly sampled **with replacement** from the dataset. This means that the same training instance can be sampled multiple times for one predictor and not at all for another. This method of sampling is termed \"bootstrapping.\"\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Every predictor in the ensemble is trained on a different bootstrap sample. This means that different instances of the predictor might be seeing slightly different data during their training.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once the predictors are trained, the ensemble can make predictions for a new instance by simply aggregating the predictions of all predictors.\n",
    "  - The aggregation function is typically the **statistical mode** (i.e., the most frequent prediction) for classification or the **average** for regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2.2 Key Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inherent parallelism** An essential feature of bagging is that the individual predictors can be trained in parallel, as they are independent of each other, which makes bagging scalable and suitable for distributed computing.\n",
    "- **Reduction in Variance**: As individual predictors might overfit to their specific bootstrap samples, when predictions from all the predictors are aggregated, the ensemble can generalize better and produce a more stable and accurate result.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Maintains Bias**: The bias remains similar to that of a single predictor because each one is trained on data sampled from the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2.3 Bagging with `sklearn`**\n",
    "\n",
    "`sklearn` provides the `BaggingClassifier`, which automates the process of training multiple instances of a predictor on different subsets of the data.\n"

    "Random Forests are a well-known powerful ML techniques that utilizes Decision Trees with bagging. However, in addition to using different bootstrap samples,  introduces randomness in feature selection when splitting a node. That is, instead of considering all features for a split, a random subset of features is chosen. There are several reasons for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Decorrelation of Trees**: One of the primary reasons for introducing randomness in feature selection at each node is to ensure that individual decision trees in the ensemble are not highly correlated. If we always chose the best features for splitting, many of the trees in the ensemble would look similar (especially at the top splits). This would diminish the benefits of ensemble averaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reduced Overfitting**: By considering only a subset of features, we prevent the trees from always splitting on the most dominant features, which can lead to overfitting. Instead, the model is forced to consider other features, leading to more diverse and generalized decision boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Computational Efficiency**: Evaluating the best split is computationally costly. By considering only a subset of features, the training time for each tree is reduced. Given that Random Forests involve training many trees, this computational saving is significant.\n",

    "One significant advantage of Random Forest is that it can provide an estimate of the importance of each feature in making accurate predictions.

    "# **Evaluation**\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical step in an ML workflow is evaluating your model. There are two important considerations when evaluating a classifier:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How to sample your data for testing and\n",
    "2. What measurements to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll talk about both of these issues below, after a brief discussion about the different types of errors and limitations of _accuracy_ as a metric for evaluating ML models. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Training Error vs. Generalization Error**\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/IST707-Week21.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, evaluating a model's performance involves understanding two key concepts: training error and generalization error. **Training error** refers to the error that the model makes on the training data, the same data it learns from. It's a measure of how well the model fits the training data. However, fitting the training data too closely can lead to overfitting, where the model captures noise along with the underlying data pattern. This is where **generalization error** comes into play. Generalization error measures how well a model performs on unseen data, that is, data not used during the training process. It's an indicator of how well the model has learned to generalize from the training data to broader, unseen instances. A model that performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data (high generalization error) is overfitted, whereas a model that achieves a balance, performing well both on training and unseen data, is considered well-generalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "Consider a model trained to predict house prices. If this model is trained on a specific dataset of house prices in a city and achieves very low error rates on this training set, it has a low training error. However, if this model, when used to predict prices of houses in a different city (unseen data), performs poorly, it has a high generalization error. The goal in model development is to minimize both training error and generalization error to create a model that is accurate and robust against unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Accuracy is Not Always Enough**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accuracy** is a commonly used metric in classification problems which calculates the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions made. It's defined as the number of correct predictions (both true positives and true negatives) divided by the total number of predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, accuracy can be misleading, especially in cases where the dataset is imbalanced, meaning there's a significant difference in the number of instances of the different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations of Accuracy\n",
    "1. **Does Not Reflect Class Imbalance**: Accuracy does not take into account the imbalance in the distribution of the classes. In a highly imbalanced dataset, even a naive model predicting only the majority class can yield a high accuracy.\n",
    "2. **No Insight into Type of Errors**: Accuracy does not distinguish between the types of errors (false positives vs. false negatives), which can be critical in certain domains like medical diagnosis or fraud detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Breast Cancer Testing\n",
    "Consider a breast cancer screening test applied to 1000 individuals with an accuracy of 94.5%, and the base rate of breast cancer in this population is 5%.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Out of 1000 individuals, 50 (5%) have breast cancer, and 950 (95%) do not.\n",
    "- With an accuracy of 94.5%, the test correctly identifies 945 individuals (both cancer and non-cancer cases).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down this accuracy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **True Positives (TP)**: These are individuals who have breast cancer and are correctly identified by the test as having it.\n",
    "2. **True Negatives (TN)**: These are individuals who do not have breast cancer and are correctly identified by the test as not having it.\n",
    "3. **False Positives (FP)**: These are individuals who do not have breast cancer but are incorrectly identified by the test as having it.\n",
    "4. **False Negatives (FN)**: These are individuals who have breast cancer but are incorrectly identified by the test as not having it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the accuracy and base rate, we can't directly deduce the exact number of TP, FP, TN, and FN, but we can infer the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If all 50 actual cancer cases are correctly identified, then we have 50 TPs. The remaining 895 correct predictions must be TNs (945 correct predictions minus 50 TPs). This would leave 55 incorrect predictions (1000 total minus 945 correct predictions), which would all have to be FPs since all the TPs are accounted for. This scenario implies a very high false positive rate.\n",
    "- Conversely, if some of the cancer cases are missed (FNs), the number of FPs would decrease, but this would increase the FN rate, which is also problematic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, even with a high accuracy of 94.5%, the low base rate of cancer significantly affects the interpretation of the result. A high number of false positives or false negatives can still occur, which can be critical in a medical context. This example illustrates why accuracy alone, especially in the context of imbalanced datasets, might not be a sufficient metric for evaluating the performance of a diagnostic test. Other metrics like precision, recall, and the F1 score are crucial for a more complete evaluation.\n"

This is particularly crucial when dealing with imbalanced datasets, where one or more classes are underrepresented compared to others.\n",
    "\n",
    "When performing a train-test split without stratification in an imbalanced dataset, there's a risk that the distribution of classes in the training and testing sets will be significantly different from each other and from the original dataset. This can lead to biased or inaccurate models, as the model may not be trained or evaluated on a representative sample of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stratification addresses this issue by dividing the data in a way that maintains the same proportion of each class in both the training and testing sets as found in the original dataset. In Scikit-Learn's `train_test_split` function, this is achieved by setting the `stratify` parameter to the class labels.

    "\n",
    "After observing that a single train-test split can lead to varying results, cross-validation emerges as a solution to gain a more stable and accurate estimate of a model's performance. In cross-validation, the dataset is divided into multiple smaller sets or \"folds\". The model is then trained and evaluated multiple times, with each fold getting a chance to serve as the test set while the remaining parts are used for training. The most common form of this technique is *k-fold cross-validation*, where the data is split into 'k' number of folds. For each iteration, a different fold is used for testing, and the rest for training. The final performance metric is typically the average of the model's performance across all folds.\n",

It ensures that every data point is used for both training and testing, which makes the evaluation more reliable and less dependent on the particular way the data is split.

In contrast, for medical diagnostics (where missing a positive diagnosis can be critical), a higher threshold might be chosen to ensure high recall.\n",

They provide a comprehensive view of model performance across various thresholds and are robust against imbalances in the class distribution.\n",

    "- **Threshold Independence**: Unlike precision and recall which depend on a specific threshold, ROC and AUC provide a threshold-independent measure of model performance. This is particularly useful when comparing different models.\n",
